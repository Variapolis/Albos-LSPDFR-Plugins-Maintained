# Albo's LSPDFR Plugins Maintained

Due to the previous maintained version of Albo's plugins not being open-source and being taken down. I've decided to upload a open-source maintained version of the plugin that can be contributed and forked by anyone and hopefully maintained for longer into the future.

Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies into a new **Albo1125.Common/dependencies** folder. It should then build without issue.

The code could use some refactoring and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for.

# Arrest Manager
Arrest Manager is a plugin for LSPDFR by Albo1125 with nearly one million downloads on lspdfr.com. Originally released in 2015 under the name of 'More Jail Points', this is the first plugin for LSPDFR I ever wrote. In fact, it was my first ever proper C# project.

## Code & building
Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies into a new **Arrest Manager/dependencies** folder. It should then build without issue.

I know, I know, the code is FAR from perfect. 
This project sprung into life when I started learning C# and it originally started off as just a bit of toying around in my first ever object-oriented programming language.
Who remembers the More Jail Points and then the More Jail Points & Prisoner Transporter days? Yes, much of that (abysmal but functional) code remains today.

The code requires an enormous amount of refactoring and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for.

## Code & building
Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies (except WmpLib, follow instructions) into a new **AssortedCallouts/dependencies** folder. It should then build without issue.

The code is not perfect, although you can see improvements when compared to some of the earlier plugins I wrote. This was the third plugin I released for LSPDFR.

The code requires some refactoring and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for (particularly the case for the hugely long Bank Heist callout).

The code is FAR from perfect. 
This project sprung into life just after I'd started learning C# and it originally started off as just a bit of toying around with ambient events.
Quite a lot of old code and...cough...old bad practice remains today.

The code requires a large amount of refactoring and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for.
